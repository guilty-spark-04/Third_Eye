# Third_Eye
Awaken Brother

Project for 2019 TAMUHack

Our purpose for making this project was to create a device that could potentially help people who are visually impaired.

It uses a Python script using the google vision cloud in order to identify objects, and texts. The script will give detail to the user of what items
are in front of them and how close they are. If there is text, the program will read the text to the user via earbuds. This script was
designed to be used on a raspberry pi with a webcam, and two HC-SR04 Ultra sonic sensors.
